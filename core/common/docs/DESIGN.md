# Design of @@APP_NAME@@

<!-- Written by the blueprint (@@BLUEPRINT_VERSION@@) from project.conf: do not edit, run build.sh. -->

@@APP_NAME@@ uses the design system of the project blueprint @@BLUEPRINT_VERSION@@, unchanged: the same
colors, fonts, sizes, layout, components, logo style and wording as every project of the family.

- The specification: [`.blueprint/spec/01-design.md`](../.blueprint/spec/01-design.md) and
  [`.blueprint/spec/02-logo.md`](../.blueprint/spec/02-logo.md)
- The design system itself: [`src/css/base.css`](../src/css/base.css), [`src/fonts/`](../src/fonts),
  [`src/js/core/`](../src/js/core) (never edited in this project)
- This app's own styles: [`src/css/app.css`](../src/css/app.css), built only from the tokens of base.css
- The logo: [`assets/logo/`](../assets/logo), pattern `@@LOGO_PATTERN@@` with the colors `@@LOGO_COLORS@@`
- Reference screenshots: [`.blueprint/spec/screens/`](../.blueprint/spec/screens)
- Deliberate differences, approved by the owner: [`DEVIATIONS.md`](../DEVIATIONS.md)
